### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    I really enjoyed working on Lab 12 Part-1. I was very interested in learning how to create an image using Magick and RGB functions. I also enjoyed using the math expression of Sin in my code.

* Lab 10

    Another lab that I really enjoyed working on is lab 10 Part-2. I enjoyed working on lab 10 because I like a challenge, and I feel like I was challenged the most on this lab. With the vector and then having to pull information from a specific spot in the vector. 

* Lab 11

    One last lab that I really enjoyed working on is lab 11 part-2. I enjoyed lab 11 because I found it very interesting how you can use the classes in your function. I also enjoyed it because it made me learn about how to use the class corectly.
